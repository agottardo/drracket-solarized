Solarized Colorscheme for DrRacket
==================================

This package adds a Solarized colorscheme to DrRacket, the IDE
of the [Racket programming language](http://www.racket-lang.org).

See the [Solarized homepage](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) for
screenshots, details and colorscheme versions for Vim, Mutt, popular terminal
emulators and other applications.

Note: colorschemes are only supported on Racket 6 pre-release
versions. Current pre-release snapshots can be downloaded
[here](http://www.cs.utah.edu/plt/snapshots/).
